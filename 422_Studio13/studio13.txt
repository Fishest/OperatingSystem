For processes that share the same memory region, they need a consensus on what is in the memory and how it looks like. Otherwise,
if the layout of the memory is not agreed on, then one process could corrupt the shared memory and break other processes.

I expect memcpy to be more efficient as it directly copy a chunk of memory from
source to destination without considering the type of data being copied.
Iterating through the array and copy each item incurs overhead and might involve
data copying and type conversion that are time consuming.
