Browserblocking and thd-461 briefly interrupted the CPU because they occupied the CPU for
a relatively short amount of time.

4.
Both are working at priority of 99.

5.
There are much less interrupts when running with priority 1

6.
Only 5 sched_switch on CPU core 3 that I used. Other cores have significantly more such interrupts.
Especially CPU 0 and 2. CPU 1 had less niterrupts.

7.
migration0 to migration3, and [irq/92-mmc1]. The migration processes have to adjust in real time how much work they should do

8. 
sched_switch happened 6 times, and they mostly occurred at the beginning or end of the program.

9.
Based on the marker, it takes roughly 0.001 seconds to switch between multiple processes.
