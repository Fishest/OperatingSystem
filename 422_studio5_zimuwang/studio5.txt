#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

}

3. 
man -s 2 access
Access function checks user's permissions for a file

man -s 2 mmap2
mmap2 function map files or devices into memory

4. 
the write system call is invoked 

5.
In the dense300 function, mmap is called more times, while brk in dense100 is called more.
Because dense300 uses more memory to store the matrices.

6.
Similarly, the one with smaller size has more brk function calls. The one with larger size 
has more mmap2 function calls to allocate that much memory.

About 5 seconds. Didn't really pay attension to it.

sched_switch and lxterminal

10.
It seems like sched_switch preempted the task

11.
Core 2 was doing trace-cmd and dense_mm most of the time, sched_switch almost never happened
Core 0 was idle
Core 1 was doing low level work I assume, with fair amount of sched_switch
Core 3 was doing Xorg, similar to Core 1

12.
At the beginning, I think scheduler is working to distribute the tasks to cores.
