The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with eager feet,
Until it joins some larger way,
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say.

According to help time, the time function returns the real time, user CPU time and system CPU time. 
Real = user + system 
user: time spent in user-space
systemL time spent in kernel-space

The real time is shorter when using parallel_dense_mm, and it makes sense because it uses multiple thread. 
However, the total time used is almost the same, with parallel_dense_mm being a bit higher because it involves
scheduling and actually distributing the work.

6.
Based on several runs, it seems like the kernel-space time usage is higher than user-space usage. As
most of the work of the program is printing out things to standard output, it uses kernel-space more often

7. 
CLOCK+MONOTONIC would be good for user-space as it is not affected by system clock jumping around
CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE would be bad because it is coarse, and bad for measuring in particular small programs,
and it is affected by discontinuity in system clock.

8.
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop/Operating System/422_Studio4_zimuwang $ ./getres
CLOCK_REALTIME: seconds=0, nano_sec=1
CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE: seconds=0, nano_sec=10000000
CLOCK_MONOTONIC: seconds=0, nano_sec=1
CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE: seconds=0, nano_sec=10000000

9.
The difference should be in the frequency. REALTIME is on the nano_sec level, while coarse ones are operating at 1sec/(10000000nanosecond) Hz

Calling the clock_gettime twice and record two time signatures. It makes sense that the time clock_gettime
takes will be the difference between the two. However, this involves a gap between function execution so there might be error.

Common running time is on the minimum side, as the average is close to minimum.
