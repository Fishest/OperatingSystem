=== Module Design ===
The get_current_time function uses getnstimeofday function, and convert the timespec structure
into an unsigned long long that is in nanosecond. 
At monitor_sched_in, a new entry is created with start time being the current time. 
When monitor_sched_out is called, the tracker gets the current entry, which is stored as a 
member variable, and update its end_time. On piazza, the addition requirement that the first
sched_out is ignored can be implemented with a flag in the tracker. It will correctly execute the 
logic starting from the second monitor_sched_out. All other requirements, such as which core it is ran on, and which process preempted it, are 
recorded in sched_in and sched_out, respectively.
It turns out the in the default list implementation, the list_head is never iterated on in
list_for_each_entry_safe or list_empty function. As a result, when the list is initialized in 
monitor_open method, a dummy head is created. When we are removing items from monitor reads or 
monitor flush, we can make sure that we will never deal with null pointers when removing the list items.
All the lock objects are  members of the preemption_tracker object, meaning that each tracker will
have its own lock and lock_macro that is passed into the spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock_irqrestore function.
